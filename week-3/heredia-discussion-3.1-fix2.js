Expected Outcome
Today is (Current Day!)

//The switch function should return the current day based off whatever day it is.
switch (new Date().getDay()) { //Corrected syntax to .getDay()
    case 0:
        console.log ("Today is Sunday!");
        break;
    case 1:
        console.log("Today is Monday!");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("Today is Tuesday!");
        break;
    case 3:
        console.log("Today is Wednesday!");

    case 4:
        console.log("Today is Thursday!");
        break;
    case 5:
        console.log("Today is Friday"); //added missing parentheses
